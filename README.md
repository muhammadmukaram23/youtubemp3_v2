# YouTube to MP3 Converter - Automatic Download System

## Overview
This YouTube to MP3 converter now features an **automatic download system** that:
- ✅ **No longer saves files permanently** in the project's downloads folder
- ✅ **Automatically downloads files** to user's computer without manual clicking
- ✅ **Cleans up temporary files** immediately after download
- ✅ **Uses temporary directories** for processing

## Key Features

### 🚀 Automatic Downloads
- Files are automatically downloaded to user's computer when conversion completes
- No need to click download buttons - it happens automatically!
- Users see a success notification when download starts

### 🧹 Smart Cleanup
- Files are stored in temporary directories during processing
- Temporary files are automatically deleted after serving to user
- Old temp directories are cleaned up on server startup
- Background cleanup removes old files and tasks

### 💾 No Permanent Storage
- Files are no longer stored permanently in the `downloads/` folder
- Each conversion uses its own temporary directory (`temp_[task_id]`)
- Files are streamed directly to user and then deleted

## How It Works

1. **User submits URL** → Conversion starts
2. **File processing** → Stored in temporary directory (`temp_[task_id]`)
3. **Conversion complete** → Automatic download triggered
4. **File served** → User gets file in their Downloads folder
5. **Cleanup** → Temporary directory deleted automatically
